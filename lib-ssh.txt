I checked it on nmap and found that this site run ssh service on a OpenSSh version. So searchsploit
might be a good choise.

It type is remote so I can run commands remotely and it does not have a security and runs all commands
this is its vulnerability and by this we can get information.

sudo nmap -sV -A -T4 -sC -sS 35.198.135.192

searchsploit lib
searchsploit -m linux/remote/46307.py
