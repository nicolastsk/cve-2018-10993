Firstly we need to look at the inspection mode and there we see that file is located in
 
It tells us about LFI vulnerability (local file inclusion) in the ‘image_name’ part
So now we should to get back to the source file
 
 
As we can see there is a block for this vulnerability and to overcome it we can use ‘//’ instead of ‘/’ as the block is on char symbols
 
As a result we got this
 
 and by this we understand that there is an FLI vulnerability
So now lets try to find our flag by using hint location (temporary (tmp))
 
And here it is
 

image_name=..//..//..//etc/passwd

image_name=..//tmp/flag
